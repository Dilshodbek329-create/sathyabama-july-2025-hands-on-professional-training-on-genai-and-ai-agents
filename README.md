## Overview

This repository contains materials for the hands-on training at Sathyabama University in July 2025, focusing on Generative AI (GenAI) and AI agents. Participants will gain practical experience in creating chatbots, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from various data sources, and building intelligent agents using popular frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and LangFlow. 

The training will also cover integration with Google ADK and n8n, along with Python best practices. This comprehensive approach ensures participants leave with a solid foundation in both theory and practical skills.

## Topics Covered

The training encompasses a wide range of topics, including:

- **AI Agents**: Understand the architecture and functionalities of AI agents.
- **AI Chatbot Development**: Learn how to create responsive chatbots.
- **Google ADK**: Explore the Google AI Development Kit for building applications.
- **Generative AI**: Delve into the principles of generative models.
- **LangChain**: Utilize this framework for building complex AI workflows.
- **LangGraph**: Visualize and manage data flows in AI projects.
- **n8n**: Automate workflows with this powerful tool.
- **OpenAI**: Integrate OpenAI models into applications.
- **Python**: Follow best practices for writing clean, efficient code.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Learn how to enhance model responses using external data sources.

## Prerequisites

Before attending the training, participants should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with APIs and web services.
- An understanding of machine learning concepts is a plus but not mandatory.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dilshodbek329-create/sathyabama-july-2025-hands-on-professional-training-on-genai-and-ai-agents.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sathyabama-july-2025-hands-on-professional-training-on-genai-and-ai-agents
```

### Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Schedule

The training will be conducted over a week, with daily sessions covering different topics. Below is a tentative schedule:

### Day 1: Introduction to AI and Chatbots
- Overview of AI and its applications.
- Basics of chatbot development.

### Day 2: Working with Google ADK
- Setting up Google ADK.
- Building a simple application.

### Day 3: Understanding Generative AI
- Principles of generative models.
- Hands-on exercises with OpenAI.

### Day 4: LangChain and LangGraph
- Introduction to LangChain.
- Building workflows with LangGraph.

### Day 5: RAG and Data Sources
- Understanding RAG.
- Working with text, PDF, web, and image data.

### Day 6: Automating with n8n
- Setting up n8n.
- Creating automated workflows.

### Day 7: Final Project and Review
- Participants will work on a final project.
- Review of key concepts and Q&A.

## Hands-On Projects

Throughout the training, participants will engage in several hands-on projects, including:

1. **Chatbot Creation**: Build a chatbot that can respond to user queries using RAG.
2. **Data Integration**: Create a project that pulls data from various sources and utilizes it in a generative model.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Use n8n to automate a series of tasks related to data processing and AI model deployment.
